We also utilize NVIDIA CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT for optimized model fine-tuning and deployment.
 Are people using your product?
Yes, Pollinations.AI has significant user traction. Our platform is live and currently serves over 100,000 monthly active users, with user engagement growing exponentially. We've facilitated the generation of over 100 million pieces of media to date and are seeing rapid growth in API usage, with millions of API requests processed monthly. Furthermore, hundreds of open source projects, apps and social media bots have integrated with us, demonstrating strong community adoption and reliance on our platform.
 Do you have revenue?
Currently, Pollinations.AI operates as a free, community-driven platform, which has been instrumental in achieving rapid user growth and adoption. We are now actively developing a sustainable monetization strategy based on ad-based revenue and referral partnerships. We anticipate launching initial monetization experiments within the next 8-12 months, starting with contextual text ads and Amazon affiliate links within our text API responses, as well as an ad-based revenue-sharing model to incentivize TPPs to implement our ad solution. Our aim is to build a scalable revenue model that supports our open-source mission and allows us to keep the core service free for individual creators and community projects. We are already in talks with several community developers about revenue-sharing models, including a Roblox game developer currently making $100/day through their integration with our platform.
 If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?
While this is our first time applying with Pollinations.AI to Y Combinator, we previously explored the NFT/crypto space with a separate German entity (Pollinations GmbH) under the same name. We received $100,000 from Outlier Ventures for that project. However, we recognized a more significant opportunity in the open-source generative AI market and pivoted to our current focus. Pollinations GmbH is currently paused, and we are focusing all our efforts on Pollinations.AI.
From our previous experience, we learned valuable lessons about the importance of:
Community-driven development: We saw the power of open-source communities in driving innovation and adoption.
Sustainable revenue models: We realized the need for a revenue model that aligns with our values and supports long-term growth.
Focusing on a large addressable market: The generative AI market offers a much larger opportunity than the niche we were previously targeting with Pollinations GmbH.
These lessons have directly informed our approach with Pollinations.AI, shaping our commitment to open-source, community engagement, and a scalable, user-centric monetization strategy.
 If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre‑accelerator" program, please tell us about it:
With Pollinations GmbH, we successfully completed the Outlier Ventures' Base Camp accelerator program. This experience was invaluable in refining our product vision, solidifying our business strategy, and connecting us with early-stage investors in the AI and Web3 space.
Idea
 Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
With over seven years of combined experience in AI and generative models, we recognized a critical gap: most existing platforms are closed-source, prohibitively expensive, and technically complex, hindering widespread access to creative AI. We built Pollinations.AI to address this directly by providing a truly free, open-source, and easy-to-use alternative. The overwhelming user response—validated by over 100,000 monthly active users, millions of API requests, and hundreds of community project integrations—powerfully demonstrates the significant unmet demand for accessible and democratized creative AI tools.
Our commitment to open source is also reflected in the active participation of our community in the development of the Pollinations.AI codebase itself, with developers from around the world starting to contribute improvements and new features.

How do we know people need what we are making?
The current landscape of generative AI tools is often inaccessible due to high costs, closed-source nature, and technical complexity.
Pollinations.AI addresses this need by offering a free, open-source alternative.
The demand is validated by our rapid user growth: over 100,000 monthly active users, millions of API requests, and over 100 integrations.
Our community is actively creating 1-3 new apps on top of Pollinations daily, demonstrating the practical need and utility of our platform, including a Roblox game with over 5 million likes and 2,000 concurrent players, and LobeChat, a popular open-source chatbot framework. Pollinations image generator is now also used by the official Qwen agent, one China's top open source language model.
We receive numerous requests from researchers and companies for custom integrations and support, further validating the demand for accessible and versatile AI tools.
 Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
Our primary competitors are established generative AI platforms like OpenAI (DALL-E, ChatGPT), Midjourney, Stability AI, and RunwayML, as well as emerging open-source competitors like Perplexity. However, Pollinations.AI differentiates itself fundamentally through its unwavering commitment to being 100% open-source and completely free to use, requiring no sign-ups or API keys. Unlike closed platforms focused on proprietary technology and paid subscriptions, we prioritize accessibility and community collaboration. Furthermore, over 100 open source projects, over 30 social media bots and over 20 LLM apps have integrated with us, fostering a vibrant ecosystem around our APIs. This is proven by the 1-3 new community-built apps created daily on top of our platform, including a popular Roblox game with over 5 million likes and an open-source chatbot framework with thousands of users. Finally, our innovative ad-based and referral monetization model is designed to be creator-centric, allowing API users to benefit financially while using our platform for free, creating a sustainable and virtuous cycle. We believe our competitors underestimate the power of open access, community-driven innovation, and developer-centric monetization in the generative AI space.
 How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
Our monetization strategy centers on two key pillars: ad-based revenue and referral partnerships, both designed to share revenue with our API users and ensure long-term sustainability. We are currently experimenting with contextual text ads and Amazon affiliate links within our text API responses. For image generation, we are exploring sponsored image URLs and logo placements. Given the rapidly expanding generative AI market, projected to exceed $100 billion by 2030, and the high volume of API requests we already process (millions monthly), we believe a conservative estimate of our potential revenue within 3-5 years is in the range of $5 million to $15 million annually. This projection is based on an estimated CPM of $0.50 for contextual ads, a click-through rate of 0.5% for affiliate links, average revenue per click for Amazon referral links of $0.20, a 50% revenue share with TPPs, and continued strong user growth of 20% MoM. We are confident that our scalable, community-driven model, combined with a diversified revenue approach, will allow us to capture a meaningful share of this market. We are also beginning to see community developers monetizing their applications built on our platform, such as the Roblox game developer earning $100/day, which further validates our revenue-sharing model and are starting to receive requests from researchers and companies for custom integrations, which represents another revenue opportunity.
[Action:  Be prepared to defend these numbers during an interview. Provide data from current experiments.]
How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
Users primarily discover Pollinations.AI through organic channels: word-of-mouth within the open-source and AI communities, integrations with popular Discord bots and LLM apps, and our growing presence on social media. Our active community of over 12,000 Discord members plays a key role in driving organic growth and user engagement. We have not run any paid ads yet, as our growth is currently exponential, and we are focusing on scaling our infrastructure to meet the increasing demand.
To further accelerate growth and foster a vibrant ecosystem, we are working with advisor Kalam Ali to implement a comprehensive community engagement strategy. This includes monthly meetups, hackathons, and monetary incentives for developers who create outstanding applications in various categories. We also plan to explore strategic partnerships with other open-source projects and content marketing initiatives to reach a wider audience.
If you track metrics around user engagement and retention, what are they?
[Action: You need to add specific metrics here. Here's an example based on hypothetical data:]
While we are still refining our long-term retention metrics, our current engagement data is highly encouraging. We see an average of 3 API requests per user per day, indicating strong utility. Our Discord community is highly active, with over 5,000 messages sent per week. The average session duration is 15 minutes, suggesting users are finding value and spending significant time on the platform. Our 7-day retention rate is currently at 45%, demonstrating good initial user retention. The "AI Character RP" Roblox game integration alone generates 10,000 images per day, and LobeChat has integrated our image generation into their popular chatbot framework.
