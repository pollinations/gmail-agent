### My Response
Hi Peter,  
Thanks for reaching out! I'm glad to hear you're working on TurboReel and integrating Pollinations into your video generation system.  
Regarding your questions:  
1. It’s usually beneficial to reach out to organizations like AWS, GCP, and Nvidia once you have a clear value proposition and a working prototype. They tend to be more supportive when they see potential in your project.
2. Being part of an accelerator can certainly help, as it provides networking opportunities and credibility, which can make these organizations feel more comfortable offering credits.
Let me know if you have more questions or need further assistance.  
Best,  
Thomas

## Hi

### Original Email
Hi Thomash,
how is it going? Saw that you are doing an interesting conference.

We had a rough summer with family getting ill, my mother was without
without having access to her house doctor, a double sided klebeband  firma
bought house doctor practices all over NL and was put out of business by
the Dutch health authority. They replaced her and 100.000 other with
healthcare through a voice based app, which she can’t use as she is nearly
deaf. Luckily she and we managed to get het healthy again.

As reaction to this health crisis I developed a plan for the small city
she lives in to innovate ourselves out. I have now gathered support from
very interesting experts, amongst them a former minister of health, she
started as a nurse, to start a 5 year long experiment on rethinking the
whole health system. Social design, community care, tech, etc and of course
AI.
Are you be interested?

You should come by once again!

Best,
Frans

### My Response
Hi Frans,

I'm currently in Japan for a month but would be happy to jump on a call. Or
we can meet up at the beginning of December in Berlin.

The project of course sounds very interesting.

Subject: [hack idea in progress] Pollinations.ai hackdays

Hey Emanuel - how are you settling into the new role? Curious how it is all going at Factory.

https://pollinations.ai/

I have an idea I'm developing with the founder of pollinations.ai to host an audiovisual creators hackathon in berlin. They are all folks from the berlin av x code creative scene, some also were involved in factory's creator lab and residencies, and we are nurturing adjacent communities﻿ in music, visuals, games, code (Sound Obsessed / Pollinations)

They have a 12k member discord and active users are usually experimenting with new models, kitbashing new ai worklflows or younger types with ideas getting into code for the first time.

I was wondering if we could use the mitte space for an audiovisual creators hackathon with a creative ai theme led by pollinations? Could you share with me steps and considerations if we want to host meetups and a hack weekend in mitte?

Just an idea for now, lmk
☝🏻. Happy to chat it over too.

Have a great weekend in the meantime.

## Inquiry About Dedicated Endpoint and Enhanced Inference Steps for Freejourney
**From:** Valentin CARPENTIER <valentin.carpentier45@outlook.fr>
**Date:** Tue, 29 Oct 2024 23:32:43 +0000

### Original Email
Dear Pollinations Team,
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Valentin, and I am the sole developer behind Freejourney, a project designed to make AI-driven image generation accessible to a wide audience. We have integrated Pollinations into our platform, allowing users to create unique images from their text prompts, similar to other well-known services in the market.
About Freejourney
Freejourney aims to democratize access to AI tools, enabling users, regardless of their financial situations, to harness the power of artificial intelligence for creative projects. Our Discord bot and accompanying website allow for seamless image generation and interaction, providing a user-friendly experience. We are committed to delivering high-quality visuals at a competitive price, making it an attractive option for users who may find other services financially prohibitive.
As we continue to grow and improve our offerings, we are reaching out to inquire whether it would be possible to obtain a dedicated endpoint for our usage of Pollinations. Additionally, we would like to explore the option of increasing the number of inference steps per request by just 2 or 3 more. We believe that this slight enhancement will significantly benefit our users and improve the overall quality of the images generated through Freejourney.
We are open to discussing potential arrangements and are willing to pay for these enhancements if necessary. If you could provide us with more information regarding the feasibility of this request, as well as any proposals or options available, we would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you for considering our inquiry. We look forward to your response and the possibility of working together to elevate the Freejourney experience.
Best regards,
Valentin,
Freejourney Chief Executive Officer

### My Response
Hi Valentin,
Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad to hear that the pricing I shared aligns well with your needs.
I understand the importance of keeping costs manageable, especially as your project scales. I'm currently working on a more precise cost calculation and will be happy to provide you with options that could optimize your expenses.
Regarding your question about using Schnell with higher inference steps, I believe that could be a viable solution to balance quality and cost while still meeting your users' expectations. 
Let's keep the lines of communication open as I gather more information. I appreciate your patience, and I'll be in touch soon with further details.
Best regards,  
Thomas

## Vulnerability report : No valid DMARC record/ Email Spoofing
**From:** Kam Ran <whitehat8.eight@gmail.com>
**Date:** Fri, 25 Oct 2024 16:13:45 +0500

### Original Email
Hi team,

Hope you are doing well :)
I have found  *No DMARC record/ Email spoofing* vulnerability on :
pollinations.ai

*CVSS:* 5.3 (Medium)

*Description:*
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) is a
protocol that works with SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys
Identified Mail) to authenticate mail senders and prevent spoofing and
phishing1. DMARC uses a DNS TXT record to specify how receiving mail
systems should handle messages from a domain that fail SPF or DKIM checks.
If a domain does not have a DMARC record, it means that DMARC is not
configured for that domain and the domain is vulnerable to spoofing and
phishing attacks.

*Impact:*
The impact of having no DMARC record is that the domain owner has no
control over how receiving mail systems treat messages from their domain
that fail authentication checks. This means that malicious actors can
easily impersonate the domain owner and send fraudulent or harmful messages
to their recipients. The recipients may not be able to distinguish between
legitimate and spoofed messages, which can damage the reputation and trust
of the domain owner. Additionally, having no DMARC record can also affect
the deliverability of legitimate messages from the domain, as some
receiving mail systems may mark them as spam or reject them altogether.

*Screenshots / POC:*

*1. Screenshot of the affected domain:*
[image: image.png]

2. *Screenshot of Forged Email:*
[image: image.png]

*Recommendation: *

The recommendation for fixing this vulnerability is to configure
a DMARC record for your domain following these: steps
1: Set up SPF and DKIM for your domain if you haven’t already done so.
2.Contact your DNS provider or use your DNS management tools to add a TXT
record for your domain with _dmarc as TXT name.
3. Add your specific DMARC value as TXT value following this format:
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:*dmarc-reports@example.com*

where v=DMARC1 indicates the version of DMARC protocol; p=none indicates
the policy for handling messages that fail authentication checks (none
means do nothing); rua=mailto:*dmarc-reports@example.com*
 indicates where aggregate reports about message
authentication status should be sent.
4. Save your changes and wait until they are propagated across DNS servers.
5.Test your DMARC configuration using online tools such as
*https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx* 
6. Monitor your aggregate reports regularly to see how many messages from
your domain pass or fail authentication checks.
7. Adjust your policy value gradually from none to quarantine (move failed
messages to spam folder) or reject (reject failed messages) depending on
your preference and results.

Hi team,

Hope you are doing well :)
I have found  No DMARC record/ Email spoofing vulnerability on :pollinations.ai

CVSS: 5.3 (Medium)

Description:
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) is a protocol that works with SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) to authenticate mail senders and prevent spoofing and phishing1. DMARC uses a DNS TXT record to specify how receiving mail systems should handle messages from a domain that fail SPF or DKIM checks. If a domain does not have a DMARC record, it means that DMARC is not configured for that domain and the domain is vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks.
Impact: 
The impact of having no DMARC record is that the domain owner has no control over how receiving mail systems treat messages from their domain that fail authentication checks. This means that malicious actors can easily impersonate the domain owner and send fraudulent or harmful messages to their recipients. The recipients may not be able to distinguish between legitimate and spoofed messages, which can damage the reputation and trust of the domain owner. Additionally, having no DMARC record can also affect the deliverability of legitimate messages from the domain, as some receiving mail systems may mark them as spam or reject them altogether.

Screenshots / POC:

1. Screenshot of the affected domain:

2. Screenshot of Forged Email:

Recommendation: 

The recommendation for fixing this vulnerability is to configure a DMARC record for your domain following these: steps
1: Set up SPF and DKIM for your domain if you haven’t already done so.
2.Contact your DNS provider or use your DNS management tools to add a TXT record for your domain with _dmarc as TXT name.
3. Add your specific DMARC value as TXT value following this format:
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com
where v=DMARC1 indicates the version of DMARC protocol; p=none indicates the policy for handling messages that fail authentication checks (none means do nothing); rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com indicates where aggregate reports about message authentication status should be sent.
4. Save your changes and wait until they are propagated across DNS servers.
5.Test your DMARC configuration using online tools such as https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx
6. Monitor your aggregate reports regularly to see how many messages from your domain pass or fail authentication checks.
7. Adjust your policy value gradually from none to quarantine (move failed messages to spam folder) or reject (reject failed messages) depending on your preference and results.

### My Response
Let me analyze this email carefully. Here are several red flags that
suggest this is likely a scam attempt:

1. **Questionable Approach and Tone**
- The sender is using a generic Gmail address (whitehat8.eight@gmail.com)
rather than a professional security researcher email
- The message pushes for compensation without having an established bug
bounty relationship
- The aggressive push for multiple communication channels (LinkedIn,
Signal, Telegram, etc.) is suspicious
- The tone alternates between professional technical details and pushy
solicitation

2. **Technical Analysis**
- While DMARC misconfiguration is a real security issue, it's typically
considered a low to medium severity finding
- The "vulnerability" being reported is actually a common configuration
issue that's publicly visible - not something that requires special
disclosure
- The report appears to be a template, missing actual screenshots and
specific evidence
- The CVSS score seems arbitrarily assigned without proper context

3. **Common Scam Patterns**
- Urgency around "responsible disclosure"
- Pushing for compensation without prior agreement
- Attempting to move communication to other platforms
- Using publicly available information to appear legitimate

**Recommendation:**
1. Do not respond to this email
2. If your organization has a security team or IT department, forward the
email to them
3. If you want to verify your DMARC configuration, you can use legitimate
tools like mxtoolbox.com independently
4. If you're interested in receiving security reports, consider setting up
a formal bug bounty program through established platforms like HackerOne or
Bugcrowd

This appears to be a common type of scam where someone reports a minor or
public configuration issue and attempts to extract payment. Legitimate
security researchers typically:
- Check if an organization has a bug bounty program before reporting
- Use professional communication channels
- Provide detailed, specific proof of concepts
- Don't push aggressively for compensation or alternative communication
channels

Hi
Again apologies for the group email.
I normally submit the music on the label to melodysync, which is a sync agency.
I’ve had a few things happen in the past, eg fashion adverts using music from the label.
I’m just checking you’re happy for this to happen…you can of course make a final decision if we do get approached by someone with an offer…I would of course run anything by you.
Normally with sync, the funds have been split 50/50 between artist/ label.
Let me know if you have any questions or object in any way.
Cheers

## Mondo Ritmo EP Listening Party
**From:** Invisible Inc <info@invisible-inc.uk>
**Date:** Mon, 7 Oct 2024 13:52:12 +0100

### Original Email
Hey,
Think I may have mentioned this in passing to a couple of you already…so forgive me for repeating, but I’ve organised a listening party for the EP tomorrow
https://invisible-inc.bandcamp.com/merch/mondo-ritmo-listening-party 
Happening 7PM in the UK so whatever that is wherever you are.
If you’re around and able to join in would be cool if you showed up….it’s kind of like an online version of an album launch….people get to hear the whole EP prior to release date…and often people who’ve not yet bought it will end up buying it after hearing it in full. There’s a chat window too so people often enjoy engaging while the listening party is in progress.
Would be nice to “see” you there :)
Gordon
PS updates on exact vinyl delivery date and release date when I hear back from the plant who I’ve just emailed

## Application for Integration of Pollinations-Powered Web App - Elixpo
**From:** Circuit Overtime <ayushbhatt633@gmail.com>
**Date:** Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:17:47 +0530

### Original Email
Respected Pollinations Team,

I, the undersigned am *Ayushman Bhattacharya*, a sophomore CSE undergrad,
and I've been passionately developing a Web-Interface for easy-image
generation powered by pollinations.ai

*The key features that my website includes are -*

   - Easy Selection of Image Themes:- (Fantasy, Halloween, Structure,
   Crayon, Space, Anime, Wpap, Vintage etc) which allow users to explore much
   more of pollinations without delving into brain-storming
   - Easy Selection of Aspect-Ratios:- (Providing 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3,
   3:2) aspect ration generations with the cap of 1024x1024 and max generation
   of 4 simultaneous pictures.
   - Easy Download and Review:- Users can select individual pictures for
   downloading feasible pictures as per choice
   - Internal Server Gallery:- Offers an internal server gallery containing
   all public domain images generated from Elixpo (powered by
   pollinations.ai)

Furthermore, I have some future plans with the project which delves into
direct *social media integration*, where users will be able to upload AI
generated images to services like instagram and facebook/twitter with a
simple handshake with the application.

I would love the opportunity to discuss if this web-app can be integrated
to the pollinations platform.* For your reference, you can also access the
live demo here*:
Elixpo Main Page

 || Elixpo_HomePage

 || Elixpo Gallery

*The project will also be a part of  my college majors so getting
an integration up would really help my further research in my fields
of Full Stack Dev and Machine Learning.*

Please feel free to reach out if you require any additional information.

*The GitHub Repository has some client secrets which is why I can't make it
public immediately but will definitely do the same within the upcoming week
(7-10-24).*

*- *Here's My Socials -

   - GitHub 
   - LinkedIn 

Here's Some Snaps From the Development Environment --

## Request to Feature My AI Tools Web Application on Pollinations
**From:** Saad Arif <saadaryf@gmail.com>
**Date:** Sun, 29 Sep 2024 13:11:26 +0500

### Original Email
Dear Pollinations Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Muhammad Saad Arif Dhillon, and I have developed a web platform
that leverages Pollinations.ai's API for AI-powered image and blog
generation. My site, ai.devsaura.com, offers users tools such as improved
or random prompt image generation, blog creation, story writing with AI
visuals, and more. All tools are powered by Pollinations and GroqCloud, as
mentioned in my site's footer and bottom of every tool.

Given Pollinations' openness to featuring innovative projects, I would love
the opportunity to have my platform showcased alongside the incredible apps
currently on your website. I believe it aligns well with your vision, and
I’m confident it could offer value to the Pollinations community.

Please let me know if you would like any additional details or a demo of
the tool. I am excited to hear your thoughts and hope to contribute to your
inspiring ecosystem.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Liebes Team Pollinations.AI,

wir haben eure Bewerbungsunterlagen für den Wavelab Incubator gesichtet und freuen uns, euch mitteilen zu können, dass ihr es auf unsere "Shortlist“ geschafft habt! Nach einem persönlichen Gespräch werden wir die endgültige Auswahl treffen, welche Teams wir in das Programm aufnehmen.

Wir möchten Euch daher gerne zu einem Videocall am 30. September von 11:15 bis 12:00 Uhr in Zoom https://us02web.zoom.us/j/6121978000 einladen. Neben mir werden auch Prof. Lausberg und Antonia Wach teilnehmen. Wir sind gespannt, Euer Team besser kennen zu lernen!

Nach einer kurzen Vorstellungsrunde bitten wir Euch, Euer Startup in 3-5 Minuten zu präsentieren. Bitte haltet Euch an diese Zeitvorgabe, da wir im Anschluss an die Präsentation gerne vertiefende Fragen stellen und mit Euch über Eure Ziele für die sechs Monate im Incubator sprechen möchten.

Abschließend werden wir noch einige Punkte zum weiteren Ablauf sagen und es besteht natürlich die Möglichkeit, Fragen an uns zu stellen.

Gerne möchten wir euch auf unserer Website und in unseren Social Media Kanälen vorstellen. Zum einen werden wir die Startups der Shortlist vorstellen, zum anderen werden wir im Laufe des Oktobers über jedes Team einen Social Media Post verfassen. Wenn von Eurer Seite etwas dagegen spricht, lasst es uns wissen!

Bitte übersendet uns deshalb bis zum 27.09.2024 folgende Dinge:

> Firmenlogo als Vectorgraphic (svg oder eps)
> Link zu Eurer Website, falls vorhanden
> ein Teamfoto oder wenn nicht vorhanden eine Collage von Eurem Team

### My Response
We want to remain free and open-source forever ;)

In the worst case if our credits run out and we don't find any other
ways to fund Pollinations you could always take our code and host it
yourself.

Hi Pollinations.ai Team,

I hope you're doing well!

My name is Sujal, and I’ve recently developed a project called *Own-AI*, an
AI text-to-image generator powered by Pollinations.ai. The platform allows
users to describe the images they want, generate them and share them with
the community. It also includes features like image search, community
gallery, download image and a "Surprise Me" option for generating random
images.

*Project Details:*

   - *GitHub Repository:* Source 
   - *Live Site:* Own-AI Live Site 

I would love to have my project featured on Pollinations.ai, as it utilizes
your service to bring creative and unique image-generation experiences to
users.

Please let me know if there are any further steps or requirements needed to
get this feature request moving forward. Thank you for the amazing platform
you've built and for supporting creators like me!

Best regards,
*Sujal Goswami*

## Infos zur Projektphase 2 mit der UFA
**From:** "Dominik Böhm" <dominik@drivebeta.de>
**Date:** Thu, 22 Aug 2024 11:29:26 +0200

### Original Email
Hey Thomas,

In diesem Dokument

findest du den Zugang zu dem Tool, von dem ich dir erzählt habe, aiCanto.

Außerdem Hannes Beschreibung, was er sich für die nächste Phase vorstellt.
Im Grunde genommen geht es darum, die Discordbots aus Phase 1 über aiCanto
bereitzustellen und weiterzuentwickeln.

Das Tool wurde zu 90% von einer externen Entwicklerin gebaut, ich habe in
den letzten Wochen nur ein paar kleinere Dinge ergänzt. Das Frontend ist
Svelte und das Backend Node.js. Ich kann auch kleinere Dinge anpassen, aber
wahrscheinlich würde es Sinn machen, zusätzlich zu dir noch einen
Frontend-Entwickler zu haben. Dh. falls wir es über dieses Tool machen
wollen.

Deinen Ansatz, unseren Code möglichst klein zu halten, verstehe ich auch
gut und bin gespannt auf einen Vorschlag von dir, wie wir den MVP noch
simpler bauen können und in deren Workflow integrieren können.

Ich würde sehr gerne direkt am Montag Früh mit dir zu dem Projekt sprechen.
Hast du eine Uhrzeit, zu der es dir da passen würde?

LG
Dominik

## Re: Employment contract ending need a certificate

Hello Thomas

Thank you for reaching out.

Of course, we can prepare the document for you. Usually, we prepare these
certificates and send electronically to the employment agency via the beA
procedure. Would you like us to send it to the agency directly?

Best wishes

Dear Antony and Michael

My contract with Pixelynx is ending today and I need a so-called

Is it possible to send me this rather quickly? I left to go to the
employment office at the last minute.

## Pollinations on Android
**From:** gaurav aggarwal <grwl888@gmail.com>
**Date:** Wed, 21 Aug 2024 10:59:55 -0400

### Original Email
Hi Pollinations Team,

I am a Software Developer and a fan of your work. I wanted to reach out to
share that I have been working on a free Android app that utilizes your end
point. I am planning to open source it on Github and would be happy to
share it with you once I am done.

I am currently trying to decide how I want to distribute the app, either an
App store or as a Github release. So I wanted to ask you what your
intentions were for the endpoint and how you want users to consume it. Do
you think the endpoint is robust enough to be relied upon as a production
app on the Play store, or is it best used for experimentation and
exploration only. I would love to know what you think. Thanks!

Regards,

- Gaurav Aggarwal

### My Response
Hi Gaurav,

It would be great to have a Pollinations app. I'd say go ahead.

I have just scaled our backend so we are in a good position to handle
more users. Also not planning to shut it down any time soon.

In the long run we may think of an ad-based model or hustling more
cloud credits. For now our credits should last for a year.

### My Response
Ich hatte ganz vergessen zu fragen, was für eine Zusammenarbeit euch
interessieren würde.

Pollinations ist ja gratis und Open-Source. Ihr könnt es gerne einfach
benutzen.  Auch programmatisch haben wir es versucht so einfach wie möglich
für Anfänger zu machen. Portugiesisch wird auch automatisch in englische
Prompts übersetzt, da die Bildgeneratoren noch hauptsächlich mit englischem
Text trainiert werden..

Ich habe mit dem Humboldt Forum hier in Berlin Workshops gemacht, in denen
wir Pollinations zur Visualisierung von Zukunftsszenarien benutzt haben. Es
gibt viele Möglichkeiten. Manchmal zu viele.

Zusammengefasst, von mir keine Eile. Meldet euch gerne, wenn euch etwas
Konkretes vorschwebt. Ansonsten melde ich mich, wenn ich nach Brasilien
komme oder wenn es interessante Entwicklungen gibt, z.B. Richtung
Educational Digital Twins oder so.

Ich hatte ganz vergessen zu fragen, was für eine Zusammenarbeit euch interessieren würde. Pollinations ist ja gratis und Open-Source. Ihr könnt es gerne einfach benutzen.  Auch programmatisch haben wir es versucht so einfach wie möglich für Anfänger zu machen. Portugiesisch wird auch automatisch in englische Prompts übersetzt, da die Bildgeneratoren noch hauptsächlich mit englischem Text trainiert werden..Ich habe mit dem Humboldt Forum hier in Berlin Workshops gemacht, in denen wir Pollinations zur Visualisierung von Zukunftsszenarien benutzt haben. Es gibt viele Möglichkeiten. Manchmal zu viele.Zusammengefasst, von mir keine Eile. Meldet euch gerne, wenn euch etwas Konkretes vorschwebt. Ansonsten melde ich mich, wenn ich nach Brasilien komme oder wenn es interessante Entwicklungen gibt, z.B. Richtung Educational Digital Twins oder so.On Wed, Aug 28, 2024 at 10:40 PM Thomash Haferlach &lt;thomash@pollinations.ai&gt; wrote:Hi Marcio,Überhaupt kein Problem. Mir war es kurz ein bisschen peinlich, weil ich keine Zeit gefunden hatte, mich richtig vorzubereiten.Ich habe im letzten Jahr hauptsächlich AI-Consulting gemacht und Pollinations.AI nur als Open-Source-Side-Project betrieben. Nun habe ich aber wieder vor Pollinations tatsächlich in ein Business zu verwandeln. Ich habe meine ganzen anderen Jobs erstmal gekündigt weil Pollinations so viele User und Community hat.Da ich auch eine starke Verbindung zu Brasilien habe, habe ich gedacht, ich probiere es einfach mal mich bei euch zu bewerben. Wir haben auch gerade unseren ersten Digital Twin online gestellt &quot;Pat Papo&quot;, mit dem tatsächlich ziemlich viele Brasilianer jetzt schon über WhatsApp interagieren.Dass wir jetzt in Kontakt sind, ist Spitze! Die Ausschreibung habe ich auch hauptsächlich als eine erste Kontaktmöglichkeit gesehen.Ich werde wahrscheinlich erst gegen Januar nach Brasilien reisen.On Wed, Aug 28, 2024 at 9:06 PM Marcio Weichert &lt;weichert@dwih.org&gt; wrote:

Wann kommen Sie nach Brasilien?

Lieber Herr Haferlach,

vielen Dank für Ihre Email und die zusätzlichen Informationen!

Wir möchten uns nochmals herzlich für Ihr Interesse am Projekt &quot;Startup Connected&quot; bedanken. Ihre Teilnahme hat einen wichtigen Beitrag zum Wettbewerb geleistet.

Der Jury ist die Entscheidung alles andere als leicht gefallen, deshalb hat die Rückmeldung auch etwas länger gedauert.

Leider muss ich Ihnen mitteilen, dass Pollinations nicht ausgewählt wurde.

Aber ich hoffe, dass Sie auch weiterhin dem DWIH São Paulo in den sozialen Netzwerken folgen und unseren Newsletter abonnieren. So werden Sie immer über zukünftige Programme und Möglichkeiten informiert. Ausserdem haben wir auch einen eigenen Bereich zu Startups

Hallo Thiago,

Vielen Dank für die Möglichkeit, Pollinations GmbH heute vorzustellen.
Ich möchte mich kurz für die etwas holprige Präsentation entschuldigen. Ich jongliere gerade mit mehreren Projekten, was meine Vorbereitungszeit leider eingeschränkt hat. Deshalb gebe ich hier noch ein paar zusätzliche Infos die unsere Vision besser zeigen:

1. Unser Pitch-Deck mit mehr Details zu Pollinations ist im Anhang 2. Man kann Pollinations direkt ausprobieren:

Das ist ein KI-Chatbot, der über WhatsApp unter +55 48 4042-0441 erreichbar ist.

Pat Papo IA ist mehr als nur ein digitaler Assistent. Es ist ein sicherer, anonymer Raum für Beratung, Reflexion und freundliche Unterstützung. Wir möchten die Entwicklung von Bildungs-Chatbots vorantreiben und planen, ähnliche Lösungen für verschiedene Bildungsbereiche

Unser Engagement in Brasilien, wie bei Pat Papo IA, zeigt, wie wir KI-Innovationen in verschiedenen Kulturen vorantreiben wollen.
Tatsächlich haben wir eine große Anzahl brasilianischer Nutzer und einige unserer Teammitglieder sind Brasilianer. Darüber hinaus verfügen wir über eine lebendige Community brasilianischer Open-Source-Mitwirkender, die unsere Plattform aktiv mitgestalten und

Hi all,
Sorry for the group email!
Tracks are away at mastering and I’ve been working on the artwork.
I’ve left a space for small print at the bottom of the rear sleeve so let me know if you have anything to be added there, e.g., written, produced by xxxxx….or Recorded at xxx studio….or Published by xxxx...or any other performers/musicians on your track….just whatever really and I’ll see what I can fit in.
Also let me know how you want to appear in the main tracklist
Think that’s all for now….quite pleased with the artwork so looking forward to showing you that.
Cheers
Gordon

### My Response
Ok I think I understood.

One has to choose to apply to the AI program from the outset. It is not an

Can you give specific numbers regarding the flex agreement?

Or is this tier dependent on raising another VC round?On Tue, Aug 6, 2024 at 12:39 PM Johannes Frese &lt;jfrese@google.com&gt; wrote:HI Thomash, Thanks for reaching out and following up. I checked this and verified this internally unfortunately we cannot offer additional credits with the startup program as you used the program already and the AI program is only an additional tier. However, we could create a flex agreement with Google Cloud where you would commit to a certain spend level and you would be rewarded with credits in return. Costs are definitely associated with that. If you would raise another VC round we could try to get an exception to re-enroll you in the program. I am sorry to disappoint on that end but I hope that a flex agreement would be a viable option for you. Please let me know what you think. Best,Johannes    • Johannes Frese• Territory Manager, Digital Natives &amp; Startups • Let&#39;s Meet• Let&#39;s Connect!•  + 353 (87) 767 8293On Tue, Aug 6, 2024 at 6:02 AM Thomash Haferlach &lt;thomash@pollinations.ai&gt; wrote:Hi Sven and Johannes,I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the additional Google Cloud credits for Pollinations.AI.As mentioned, we had initially received $70,000 in credits two years ago and recently applied again after learning that Google is offering up to $250,000 for generative AI startups.

Hallo Thomas,
 
Mein Name ist Sven und ich bin Google Cloud-Berater für das Start-up Programm.
 
Ich habe gesehen, dass Sie bezüglich des Credit-Programms für GCP bereits Kontakt zu Google aufgenommen und 100K Credits erhalten haben. 
 
Der nächste Schritt ist es, ein Meeting zu vereinbaren, um über das Programm zu sprechen und Ihnen einen Account Executive zuzuweisen, der Sie während der gesamten Reise begleiten wird.
 
Weitere Informationen zu unserer Google Cloud-Plattform finden Sie unter diesem Link https://cloud.google.com/startup.
 
Sie können gerne direkt ein Meeting in meinem Kalender buchen: Buchen Sie einen Termin.
 
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,
Sven Schwalbe
