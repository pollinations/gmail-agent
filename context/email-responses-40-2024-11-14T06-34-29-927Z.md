## TurboReel using Pollinations

Hey there

### My Response
Hi Peter,  
Thanks for reaching out! I'm glad to hear you're working on TurboReel and integrating Pollinations into your video generation system.  
Regarding your questions:  
1. It’s usually beneficial to reach out to organizations like AWS, GCP, and Nvidia once you have a clear value proposition and a working prototype. They tend to be more supportive when they see potential in your project.
2. Being part of an accelerator can certainly help, as it provides networking opportunities and credibility, which can make these organizations feel more comfortable offering credits.
Let me know if you have more questions or need further assistance.  
Best,  
Thomas

## Hi

**Date:** Fri, 25 Oct 2024 22:15:35 +0200

### Original Email
Hi Thomash,
how is it going? Saw that you are doing an interesting conference.

We had a rough summer with family getting ill, my mother was without
without having access to her house doctor, a double sided klebeband  firma
bought house doctor practices all over NL and was put out of business by
the Dutch health authority. They replaced her and 100.000 other with
healthcare through a voice based app, which she can’t use as she is nearly
deaf. Luckily she and we managed to get het healthy again.

As reaction to this health crisis I developed a plan for the small city
she lives in to innovate ourselves out. I have now gathered support from
very interesting experts, amongst them a former minister of health, she
started as a nurse, to start a 5 year long experiment on rethinking the
whole health system. Social design, community care, tech, etc and of course
AI.
Are you be interested?

You should come by once again!

Best,
Frans

### My Response
Hi Frans,

I'm currently in Japan for a month but would be happy to jump on a call. Or
we can meet up at the beginning of December in Berlin.

The project of course sounds very interesting.

Subject: [hack idea in progress] Pollinations.ai hackdays

Hey Emanuel - how are you settling into the new role? Curious how it is all going at Factory.

https://pollinations.ai/

I have an idea I'm developing with the founder of pollinations.ai to host an audiovisual creators hackathon in berlin. They are all folks from the berlin av x code creative scene, some also were involved in factory's creator lab and residencies, and we are nurturing adjacent communities﻿ in music, visuals, games, code (Sound Obsessed / Pollinations)

They have a 12k member discord and active users are usually experimenting with new models, kitbashing new ai worklflows or younger types with ideas getting into code for the first time.

I was wondering if we could use the mitte space for an audiovisual creators hackathon with a creative ai theme led by pollinations? Could you share with me steps and considerations if we want to host meetups and a hack weekend in mitte?

Just an idea for now, lmk
☝🏻. Happy to chat it over too.

Have a great weekend in the meantime.

## Inquiry About Dedicated Endpoint and Enhanced Inference Steps for Freejourney
**From:** Valentin CARPENTIER <valentin.carpentier45@outlook.fr>
**Date:** Tue, 29 Oct 2024 23:32:43 +0000

### Original Email
Dear Pollinations Team,
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Valentin, and I am the sole developer behind Freejourney, a project designed to make AI-driven image generation accessible to a wide audience. We have integrated Pollinations into our platform, allowing users to create unique images from their text prompts, similar to other well-known services in the market.
About Freejourney
Freejourney aims to democratize access to AI tools, enabling users, regardless of their financial situations, to harness the power of artificial intelligence for creative projects. Our Discord bot and accompanying website allow for seamless image generation and interaction, providing a user-friendly experience. We are committed to delivering high-quality visuals at a competitive price, making it an attractive option for users who may find other services financially prohibitive.
As we continue to grow and improve our offerings, we are reaching out to inquire whether it would be possible to obtain a dedicated endpoint for our usage of Pollinations. Additionally, we would like to explore the option of increasing the number of inference steps per request by just 2 or 3 more. We believe that this slight enhancement will significantly benefit our users and improve the overall quality of the images generated through Freejourney.
We are open to discussing potential arrangements and are willing to pay for these enhancements if necessary. If you could provide us with more information regarding the feasibility of this request, as well as any proposals or options available, we would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you for considering our inquiry. We look forward to your response and the possibility of working together to elevate the Freejourney experience.
Best regards,
Valentin,
Freejourney Chief Executive Officer

### My Response
Hi Valentin,
Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad to hear that the pricing I shared aligns well with your needs.
I understand the importance of keeping costs manageable, especially as your project scales. I'm currently working on a more precise cost calculation and will be happy to provide you with options that could optimize your expenses.
Regarding your question about using Schnell with higher inference steps, I believe that could be a viable solution to balance quality and cost while still meeting your users' expectations. 
Let's keep the lines of communication open as I gather more information. I appreciate your patience, and I'll be in touch soon with further details.
Best regards,  
Thomas

## Vulnerability report : No valid DMARC record/ Email Spoofing
**From:** Kam Ran <whitehat8.eight@gmail.com>
**Date:** Fri, 25 Oct 2024 16:13:45 +0500

### Original Email
Hi team,

Hope you are doing well :)
I have found  *No DMARC record/ Email spoofing* vulnerability on :
pollinations.ai

*CVSS:* 5.3 (Medium)

*Description:*
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) is a
protocol that works with SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys
Identified Mail) to authenticate mail senders and prevent spoofing and
phishing1. DMARC uses a DNS TXT record to specify how receiving mail
systems should handle messages from a domain that fail SPF or DKIM checks.
If a domain does not have a DMARC record, it means that DMARC is not
configured for that domain and the domain is vulnerable to spoofing and
phishing attacks.

*Impact:*
The impact of having no DMARC record is that the domain owner has no
control over how receiving mail systems treat messages from their domain
that fail authentication checks. This means that malicious actors can
easily impersonate the domain owner and send fraudulent or harmful messages
to their recipients. The recipients may not be able to distinguish between
legitimate and spoofed messages, which can damage the reputation and trust
of the domain owner. Additionally, having no DMARC record can also affect
the deliverability of legitimate messages from the domain, as some
receiving mail systems may mark them as spam or reject them altogether.

*Screenshots / POC:*

*1. Screenshot of the affected domain:*
[image: image.png]

2. *Screenshot of Forged Email:*
[image: image.png]

*Recommendation: *

The recommendation for fixing this vulnerability is to configure
a DMARC record for your domain following these: steps
1: Set up SPF and DKIM for your domain if you haven’t already done so.
2.Contact your DNS provider or use your DNS management tools to add a TXT
record for your domain with _dmarc as TXT name.
3. Add your specific DMARC value as TXT value following this format:
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:*dmarc-reports@example.com*

where v=DMARC1 indicates the version of DMARC protocol; p=none indicates
the policy for handling messages that fail authentication checks (none
means do nothing); rua=mailto:*dmarc-reports@example.com*
 indicates where aggregate reports about message
authentication status should be sent.
4. Save your changes and wait until they are propagated across DNS servers.
5.Test your DMARC configuration using online tools such as
*https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx* 
6. Monitor your aggregate reports regularly to see how many messages from
your domain pass or fail authentication checks.
7. Adjust your policy value gradually from none to quarantine (move failed
messages to spam folder) or reject (reject failed messages) depending on
your preference and results.

*References:*

1*.*
